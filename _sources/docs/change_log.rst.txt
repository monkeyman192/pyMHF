Change Log
==========

Current (0.1.17.dev)
--------------------

- Further improved partial structs to allow nesting references to themselves as a type (must be "indirect", ie. the type of a pointer, or dynamic array for example).
- Added a fallback method to calculate the binary hash in case opening the file fails. Thanks to [@sparrow](https://github.com/samjviana) for implementing this.

0.1.16 (16/08/2025)
-------------------

- Improved hooking performance by using the bulk enable mode in minhook. (`#26 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/26>`_)
- Fixed an issue running mods where attach to already existing processes.
- Fixed an issue with getting the caller offset address.
- Added the ability to specify an already running processes' PID to attach pyMHF. (`#75 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/75>`_)
- Made :py:func:`~pymhf.main.run_module` a public method as the recommended way to invoke pyMHF from code. (`#76 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/76>`_)
- Added config options to not use the interactive python interpreter and not show the log window. (`#76 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/76>`_)
- Added `pyrun_injected <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyrun_injected>`_ as a dependency to allow injecting python versions greater than 3.11.
- Improved custom callback functionality by allowing extra arguments to be passed to the called functions.

0.1.15 (16/07/2025)
-------------------

- Fixed an issue where the `this` argument wouldn't get correctly determined to be a pointer.
- Added the configured mod directory to the system path to aide in inter-mod communication.
- Improved support for mod folders which contained sub-folder for each mod. Now each folder is added to the system path if it contains any mods. (`#71 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/71>`_)

0.1.14 (09/07/2025)
-------------------

- Added the ability for partial classes to subclass from another partial struct or ``ctypes.Structure``.
- Change mod folder loading so that it will load from sub-folders as well. (`#64 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/64>`_)
- Implement a offset cache - This will reduce start up times after the initial load for any pattern which has already been found for the same binary. (`#2 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/2>`_)
- Changed the `@disable` decorator so that it can be applied to mods as well as hooks.
- Made some internal changes so that mods which define the same hook (whether by having the same pattern or a different one that resolves to the same offset) will not cause a clash. (`#53 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/53>`_)
- Fixed an issue that meant that the numbers logged for loaded mods and hooks wasn't correct.

0.1.13 (26/06/2025)
-------------------

- Fixed an issue where function definitions defined with a pointer as their ``this`` argument weren't able to be called correctly.
- Fixed an issue where calling a library directly with ``pymhf run <library path>`` wouldn't be able to import the library.
- Improved front-facing type hinting.

0.1.12 (23/06/2025)
--------------------

- Identified and fixed partially by config changes and partially by documentation issues with pyMHF being run with uv. Thanks to `@Foundit3923 <https://github.com/Foundit3923>`_ for helping to figure out the issues.
- Improved inter-mod communication.
- Added the ability to specify the total size of a partial struct using the ``_total_size_`` attribute. This will be utilised more in some upcoming changes which should simplify initialization of structs from memory using hooked functions.
- Added a new way to specify the data required for hooking and calling functions. See :doc:`here </docs/creating_hook_definitions>` for more details. This method will completely replace the old method of using the ``__pymhf_func_offsets__`` etc. "magic" mod attributes.
- Added a :py:func:`~pymhf.extensions.ctypes.c_enum32` type which can be used to construct enums as fields.

0.1.11 (29/04/2025)
--------------------

- Added the :py:func:`pymhf.gui.decorators.gui_combobox` decorator (partial work on `#15 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/15>`_).
- Added the ability for mods to access each others' attributes and methods. (`#5 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/5>`_). See :doc:`this page </docs/inter_mod_functionality>` for more details.
- Fixed a few issues regarding running pyMHF. Thanks to `@Foundit3923 <https://github.com/Foundit3923>`_ for helping to figure out the issues.
- Fixed an issue where hooks of imported functions which have ``_result_`` as an argument work.
- Added :py:func:`pymhf.core.hooking.NOOP` decorator which indicates that the original game function shouldn't be called. (`#20 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/20>`_)
- Added a hex editor to the pyMHF gui. This is accessible from the "Hex Viewer" tab of the gui and allows real time viewing of data, following pointer values, and capturing memory snapshots. (`#43 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/43>`_).
- Fixed an issue with loading hooks. Thanks to `@cengelha <https://github.com/cengelha>`_ for finding the bug.
- Added "always on top" gui setting to the config. Thanks to `@cengelha <https://github.com/cengelha>`_ for adding it.
- Fixed an issue with the debug mode toggle in the GUI. (`#49 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/pull/49>`_).

0.1.10 (26/02/2025)
-------------------

- Added :py:func:`pymhf.core.hooking.get_caller` decorator for detours. When added, this will determine the location the function was called from. (`#34 <https://github.com/monkeyman192/pyMHF/issues/34>`_). NOTE: This currently will only work properly for 64bit applications.
- Added an :py:func:`pymhf.core.hooking.exported` hook to allow hooking functions which are exported by the main exe.
- Added the :py:func:`pymhf.core.calling.call_exported` function which allows exported functions by the game to be called.
- Added the ability to specify in the :py:func:`pymhf.core.hooking.imported` decorator whether the detour time is ``"before"`` or ``"after"``.
- Fixed an issue where hooks defined using the :py:func:`~pymhf.core.hooking.manual_hook` decorator didn't use the ``__pymhf_func_offsets__`` etc. variables defined. (Thanks to `@hashcatHitman <https://www.github.com/hashcatHitman>`_ for finding the bug.)
- Made improvements to the shutting down of pyMHF so that when the process it is attached to exits, so does pyMHF.
- Added a class decorator :py:func:`pymhf.utils.partial_struct.partial_struct` which can be used to create ``ctypes.Structure`` types without needing to know the entire layout of the struct. See :doc:`here </docs/partial_structs>` for details.

0.1.9 (23/01/2025)
